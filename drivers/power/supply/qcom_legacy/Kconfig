	  The QPNP Type-C module supports the USB type-C protocol. It supports type-C
	  cable detection and other type-C parameters such as current-capability and
	  CC-orientation. The module does not support USB power-delivery. The driver
	  adds support to report these type-C parameters via the power-supply
	  framework.
